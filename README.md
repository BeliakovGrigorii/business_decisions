The aim of this project is to identify the most important hypotheses for improving the service of a large online store. 

The project involves loading and preprocessing data, as well as evaluating hypotheses based on the ICE and RICE criteria. Furthermore, an analysis of the results of an A/B test conducted by the company will be performed. Metrics such as average order value and number of orders per user will be examined. 

Finally, a concluding summary will be provided, outlining the results of the analysis.
